Data Visualization 2021 – Group Project 1
Topic: Beyond COVID-19
Team: 3 to 4 members
Delivery date: March, 22nd 2021 by the end of theoretical class.
Delivery form (Both are mandatory): A printed poster (A0 size) to be placed on the wall of the
school. And a digital version of the poster in PDF submitted in moodle.
Description:
COVID-19 is a phenomenon that have had implications in everybody’s life. It can be discussed
from a myriad of perspectives and fields, for instance, philosophical, social, psychological,
medical, educational, etc. Every country has taken different measures and policies to deal with
COVID-19 impact and consequences on their societies. In the end, the COVID-19 pandemic
situation is generating a lot of data, but little answers. Your objective is showing (graphically)
the implications/effects/consequences/etc., of COVID-19 in relation with some field of your
interest. Of course, a visualization alone is NOT able to answer any question, but at least you
provide a clue or open the door for another question. For instance:
• Why some countries have very little COVID-19 cases or deaths?
• Why some countries with less restrictive measures have less deaths that the ones with
more restrictive?
• Why COVID-19 is so different from other diseases as Tuberculosis or Ebola?
• What is the impact on fertility rates?
• What is the social/economic impact in developed/developing countries?
• What is the impact on children / domestic violence / school dropout?
• I can continue with 1000 more questions…. Feel free to make your own question!
Project 1 can be done using any software technology, you will deliver just a PDF and printed
poster.
The poster should include:
- Title (or question you want to answer)
- Authors
- Dataset source
